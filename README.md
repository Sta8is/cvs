# Short Description 
Our solution implements a two-phase methodology for geological image analysis. In the first phase, I developed a specialized neural network architecture leveraging state-of-the-art Vision Foundation Models, trained on both labeled and unlabeled datasets. The second phase employs an advanced prediction refinement pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to enhance segmentation accuracy and robustness.

# Installation 
1. Create a new conda environment and install the required packages:
```bash
conda create -n cvgq python=3.11
conda activate cvgq
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
2. Clone and install Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) from the official repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2
cd sam2
pip install -e .
```
3. Sam has a problem and configs should be placed in the parent sam2 folder. Inside the parent sam2 folder, run the following command:
```bash
cp -r sam2/configs/ .
```
4. Download sam2 checkpoints
```bash
cd checkpoints
bash download_ckpts.sh
cd ../.. # Return to the root folder
```
5. Download the pretrained weights from the [release page](https://github.com/Sta8is/cvs/releases/tag/v0.1). Select the file `pretrained_models.zip` and place the checkpoints in the `checkpoints` and `final_checkpoints` folders.

# Candidate for Honorable Mention

- [x] Fastest GPU Inference. My algorithm performs inference on 70 images of the public test dataset in ~ 4 minutes. 
- [ ] Fastest CPU Inference. Not tested.
- [x] Best custom model that does not use a highly abstracted API. The main model architecture is implemented in PyTorch. Only prediction refinement, I use the SAM2AutomaticMaskGenerator.
- [x] Most innovative use of unlabelled data. I use state-of-the-art semi supervised learning techniques to leverage the unlabeled data.
- [x] Best documentation. The solution report is detailed and provides a clear explanation of the methodology, implementation, and results.
